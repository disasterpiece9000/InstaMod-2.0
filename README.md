InstaMod is a toolbox of features that moderators can implement and customize to tailor fit their needs. It's built with customization in mind to ensure that each subreddit can have it’s own unique configuration. InstaMod is currently running on a network of subreddits totaling over 1,000,000 subscribers!

Every subreddit is unique and it's important that the tools the subreddit uses can adapt to meet their needs. InstaMod's deep customization options allow for it to fit seamlessly into any community. With a robust feature set and unlimited combinations of settings, InstaMod gives moderators an easy way to customize and moderate their community.

To get a better idea of the customization options available, please check out the [settings documentation](https://github.com/disasterpiece9000/InstaMod-2.0/blob/master/SettingsDocumentation.md) or one of the subreddits currently using InstaMod

## Launch Features

### User Tiers

As a user participates more and more in the community, their flair can change to represent their involvement. Certain tiers, or levels of user participation, can grant the user access to special priveledges. This includes the ability to assign themself custom flair and the ability to add CSS to their automatic flair. This system rewards frequent contributors and encourages new users to stop lurking and start participating!

### Activity Tags

Moderators can configure InstaMod to include information about user' account history in their flair . It could display a user's top 3 most used related communities, or it could be setup to display the subreddits where the user has been consistently downvoted. These are just a few examples of the endless combinations of settings at your disposal.

## Post-Launch Features

### Toxicity Report

Using the [Perspective API](https://www.perspectiveapi.com/#/home), InstaMod can instantly identify toxic comments and take action before anyone even reads it. Depending on how confident the API is that the comment is toxic, it can either be reported, marked as spam, or outright removed. This is a powerful tool for improving the quality and civility of conversations in a community.


### Custom Ratelimiting

Reddit has a built in rate-limit system to prevent spam, but with InstaMod this can be expanded and customized to ensure that users in your subreddit cannot spam comments and posts. Moderators can configure this to prevent new accounts from posting more than one submission a day, limit everyone to no more than 3 posts a week, or even limit trolls to one comment per hour. Just spitballing here but you get the idea.

### Advanced Thread Locking

Traditional thread locking is inherantly all-or-nothing. With InstaMod, a post's comment section can be filtered to dissalow certain types of comments or users. This allows users to have a conversation, while still containing the reason the thread was locked in the first place. It could be used to prevent brigades, block toxic comments, or restrict a thread to only long-time community members.

If a user doesn't meet the requirements, then their comment can either be removed or marked spam. There is also an option to automatically notify the user of their comment's deletion. Moderators simply have to assign a post a specific flair for it to be locked.

InstaMod v2.0 is currently in active development so I am not looking for any new subreddits to run it on. The first version of the project is still running on multiple subreddits which will be migrated to the new version once it's complete. If you are interested in having InstaMod run on your community, please contact me (/u/shimmyjimmy97) and I will be more than happy to discuss it further.

Thanks for checking out InstaMod!
